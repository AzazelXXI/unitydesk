## Communication and Data Flow (Based on Lark Suite Architecture)

The CSA Hello system employs a microservices architecture similar to Lark Suite, with each module operating as a separate service that communicates through:

1. **Synchronous Communication** - REST APIs for direct request-response patterns
2. **Asynchronous Communication** - Message broker for event-driven interactions
3. **Real-time Communication** - WebSockets for instant updates and notifications

All modules share common infrastructure services for authentication, storage, search, and notifications, ensuring a unified and consistent user experience across the entire platform.
