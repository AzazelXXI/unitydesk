## 🔐 Security & Access Control

### **Role-Based Access Control:**

#### **Project Manager:**

- ✅ Can create, update, delete projects
- ✅ Can manage project teams
- ✅ Can create, assign, and manage all tasks
- ✅ Full access to project statistics

#### **Team Leader:**

- ✅ Can manage tasks within assigned projects
- ✅ Can assign tasks to team members
- ✅ Can view project progress and statistics
- ❌ Cannot create/delete projects

#### **Team Members (Developer, Designer, Tester):**

- ✅ Can view assigned tasks and projects
- ✅ Can update task status and progress
- ✅ Can log time and add comments
- ❌ Cannot create tasks or manage assignments

### **Access Control Implementation:**

- ✅ JWT-based authentication (ready for implementation)
- ✅ Resource-level access control (users can only access projects they're members of)
- ✅ Action-level permissions (role-based actions)
- ✅ Dependency validation (prevent unauthorized access)

## 📋 Data Models & Schemas

### **Project Schemas:**

```python
# Input Schemas
ProjectCreate(name, description, objectives, scope, dates, budget, team_members)
ProjectUpdate(name, description, status, progress, priority, ...)

# Output Schema
ProjectResponse(id, name, status, progress, owner_id, team_leader_id, timestamps, ...)
```

### **Task Schemas:**

```python
# Input Schemas
TaskCreate(name, description, priority, estimated_hours, project_id, assignee_ids, dependency_ids)
TaskUpdate(name, description, status, priority, actual_hours, ...)
TaskAssignmentUpdate(assignee_ids)
TaskDependencyUpdate(dependency_ids)

# Output Schemas
TaskResponse(id, name, status, priority, project, assignees, dependencies, ...)
TaskListResponse(id, name, status, project_name, assignee_count, ...)
TaskStatsResponse(total_tasks, status_counts, hours_totals, ...)
```

## 🔄 Business Logic & Workflows

### **Project Lifecycle:**

1. **PLANNING** → **IN_PROGRESS** → **COMPLETED**/**CANCELLED**
2. Progress tracking (0-100%)
3. Budget and timeline management
4. Team composition changes

### **Task Lifecycle:**

1. **NOT_STARTED** → **IN_PROGRESS** → **COMPLETED**
2. Alternative flows: **BLOCKED**, **CANCELLED**
3. Time tracking (estimated vs actual)
4. Dependency resolution

### **Key Business Rules:**

- ✅ Tasks must belong to a project
- ✅ Users must have project access to view/edit tasks
- ✅ Task dependencies cannot create circular references
- ✅ Only assigned users can update task progress
- ✅ Completed tasks automatically set completion date
- ✅ Project deletion cascades to all related tasks

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Files Provided:**

1. **`test_project_task_complete.py`** - Comprehensive integration test
2. **`test_project_task_api.http`** - HTTP endpoint tests for manual testing

### **Test Coverage:**

- ✅ Project CRUD operations
- ✅ Task CRUD operations with relationships
- ✅ Task dependency management
- ✅ Access control and security
- ✅ Statistics and reporting
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **1. Database Setup:**

Ensure your PostgreSQL database has the models created:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### **2. Run Tests:**

```bash
# Integration test
python test_project_task_complete.py

# HTTP API tests
# Use VS Code REST Client with test_project_task_api.http
```

### **3. Access APIs:**

The modules are automatically integrated into your FastAPI app at:

- Projects: `http://localhost:8000/api/v2/projects`
- Tasks: `http://localhost:8000/api/v2/tasks`

### **4. API Documentation:**

FastAPI auto-generates documentation at:

- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`
